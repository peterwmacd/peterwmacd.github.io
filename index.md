## About

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I work primarily on statistical analysis of multiple networks. I am co-advised by [Dr. Elizaveta Levina](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/elevina.html) and [Dr. Ji Zhu](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/jizhu.html), and a member of their [research group](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/group.html). Previously, I received my MMath (Statistics) and my BMath (Statistics and Pure Mathematics) from the University of Waterloo (ON).

## Research Interests

### Multilayer and dynamic networks
**(with Elizaveta Levina and Ji Zhu, UMich)**

- Latent space models for common and individual structure in multiplex networks (forthcoming in Biometrika, pre-print on arXiv, `multiness` R package on GitHub).
- Latent space models for dynamic networks.

### Post-selection inference
**(with Dan Kessler and Snigdha Panigrahi, UMich)**

- Valid post-selection inference with grouped sparsity (submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research, pre-print on arXiv).

### Multiple testing and false discovery rate (FDR) control
**(with Kun Liang and Yingli Qin, UWaterloo)**

- Dynamic-adaptive procedures which control the FDR (paper in the Electronic Journal of Statistics).
- Multiple hypothesis testing with group information (book chapter in Modern Statistical Methods for Health Research).
