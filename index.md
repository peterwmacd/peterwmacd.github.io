## About

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics & Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. I work primarily on statistical analysis and methods for multiple and dynamic networks. I also have interests in post-selection inference, and formally private and fair statistical methods for network data.

I was formerly (2023-2024) a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at McGill University, under the supervision of [Dr. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).

I completed my PhD (2018-2023) at the University of Michigan, co-advised by [Dr. Elizaveta Levina](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/elevina.html) and [Dr. Ji Zhu](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/jizhu.html). I am also an alumnus of their [research group](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/group.html). Previously, I received my MMath (Statistics 2017-2018) and my BMath (Statistics and Pure Mathematics 2012-2017) from the University of Waterloo.

## Research Interests and Selected Publications

### Multilayer and dynamic networks
**(with Elizaveta Levina and Ji Zhu, UMich)**

- Latent space models for common and individual structure in multiplex networks (paper in Biometrika, `multiness` R package on CRAN).
- Latent process models for functional networks (submitted, pre-print on arXiv, `fase` R package on CRAN).
- Mesoscale inference for multilayer networks.

### Post-selection inference
**(with Dan Kessler and Snigdha Panigrahi, UMich)**

- Valid post-selection inference with grouped sparsity (paper in the Journal of Machine Learning Research).

### Multiple testing and false discovery rate (FDR) control
**(with Kun Liang and Yingli Qin, UWaterloo)**

- Dynamic-adaptive procedures which control the FDR (paper in the Electronic Journal of Statistics).
- Multiple hypothesis testing with group information (book chapter in Modern Statistical Methods for Health Research).

### Interdisciplinary work
**(supervised by Ji Zhu, UMich; Joel Rubenstein, VA Hospital and UMich Medicine)**

- Predicting incident adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cardia using machine learning of electronic health records (paper in Gastroenterology)
